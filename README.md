# 🇮🇩 Indonesian Tourism Recommender System

Welcome to the **Indonesian Tourism Recommender System**, a machine learning-based project developed as a capstone to showcase the application of **item similarity** in building a destination recommendation engine.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses collaborative filtering with **item-based similarity** to recommend travel destinations in Indonesia based on user preferences and past rating behavior.

The model compares destinations based on how similarly users have rated them, and suggests places that are most alike to a destination the user has already visited or shown interest in.

## ✈️ Key Features

- 📍 **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** using cosine similarity
- ⭐ Personalized **recommendations** based on destination ratings
- 🗺️ Focus on **Indonesian tourist spots**
- 🧹 Cleaned and preprocessed tourism data
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on user behavior and destination ratings
- 📁 Modular and easy-to-follow Python code

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled null values, and standardized ratings.
2. **Similarity Matrix**: Computed item-to-item cosine similarity based on user ratings.
3. **Recommendation Engine**: Given a destination, the system finds and ranks the most similar ones.
4. **Output**: Suggested destinations the user might also enjoy visiting.
